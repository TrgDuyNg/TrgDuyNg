# 📌 About Me

🎓 I'm an Information Technology student at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh (UEH).

🔭 I'm passionate about Web Development Engineering and enjoy exploring new technologies, building software, and contributing to meaningful projects.

🔍 I’m deeply interested in full-stack development—working with both frontend and backend technologies, learning web frameworks, and continuously expanding my skill set.

💡 I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects, solve problems creatively, and grow as a developer.
